# Simple TabList
 This plugin is an alternative to traditional plugins, which are very good, but usually very complicated to set.
 You may know the plugins that have amazing features, but you need to change things in 8 configs and copy-paste them into your perm-system? With this plugin you don't need that anymore!

# What does this plugin do
 This Plugin is showing prefix & suffixes in the TabList & Chat which you can provide by LuckPerm Groups.
 Since version 1.7 there is now also a staff chat.
 Since version 1.8 you can mute other players.
 Since version 2.1 you can set your own homes. (you can limit it in the main config)
